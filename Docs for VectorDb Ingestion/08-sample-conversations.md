## Example 7: Billing Question

**Customer:** What happens if I go over my query limit?

**AI:** Good question! Here's how we handle overages:

**Automatic Notifications:**
- Email alert at 80% of your limit
- Dashboard notification at 90%
- Final warning at 95%

**Overage Pricing:**
- Additional queries: $0.01 per query
- Billed at end of billing cycle
- No service interruption

**Your Options:**
1. **Upgrade Plan:** Get more queries monthly (recommended if this happens regularly)
2. **Pay Overage:** $0.01 per additional query
3. **Set Hard Limit:** We can prevent queries beyond your limit

**Example:**
Pink Beam plan includes 10,000 queries. If you use 11,000:
- 10,000 included in $99/month
- 1,000 extra × $0.01 = $10
- Total bill: $109

**Recommendation:** If you regularly exceed your limit, upgrading is more cost-effective. Pink Beam ($99) to Full VALIS ($299) gives you 5x more queries (50,000).

## Example 8: Product Recommendation

**Customer:** Which plan should I choose for my online store?

**AI:** For an online store, I'd recommend the **Pink Beam plan ($99/month)**. Here's why:

**Perfect for E-commerce:**
- **E-commerce Engine:** Product recommendations, inventory checks, order tracking
- **Information Engine:** Answer product questions instantly
- **Scheduling Engine:** Book consultations or demos
- **Content Engine:** Generate product descriptions
- **Social Sync:** Post to social media automatically

**Query Limit:**
- 10,000 queries/month should handle most small-medium stores
- That's ~333 customer interactions per day

**Growth Path:**
- Start with Pink Beam
- Upgrade to Full VALIS as you grow
- Add Analytics Engine for customer insights

**Alternative:**
If you're just starting and have a small catalog, **Satellite ($29)** might work initially, but you'll miss out on e-commerce-specific features.

**Not Sure?**
Start with our 14-day free trial of Pink Beam. You can always downgrade to Satellite or upgrade to Full VALIS based on your actual usage.

## Example 9: Troubleshooting

**Customer:** The chat widget isn't showing on my site.

**AI:** Let's troubleshoot this! Here are common causes:

**Quick Checks:**
1. **Code Placement:** Is the script before the `</body>` tag?
2. **Client ID:** Did you replace "YOUR_CLIENT_ID" with your actual ID?
3. **Cache:** Try clearing your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. **JavaScript Errors:** Check browser console (F12) for red errors

**Common Issues:**

**Issue:** "Widget loads but doesn't appear"
- **Fix:** Check if CSS is hiding it (z-index conflicts)
- **Fix:** Ensure the container div isn't set to `display: none`

**Issue:** "Works on desktop but not mobile"
- **Fix:** Check viewport meta tag
- **Fix:** Ensure mobile CSS isn't blocking it

**Issue:** "Shows on some pages but not others"
- **Fix:** Ensure script is on every page template
- **Fix:** Check if different templates use different headers

**Still Not Working?**
Send us:
1. Your website URL
2. Screenshot of where you placed the code
3. Any error messages from browser console

Email: pinkbeambot@gmail.com
Subject: "Widget Not Showing - [Your Website]"

We'll get it fixed within 24 hours!
