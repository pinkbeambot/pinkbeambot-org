## Step 4: Configure Your AI Agent

Customize how your AI behaves:

### Basic Settings:
- **Agent Name** — What should customers call it? (e.g., "VALIS", "Support Bot")
- **Welcome Message** — First thing customers see (e.g., "Hi! How can I help you today?")
- **Tone** — Professional, friendly, casual, or technical?
- **Avatar** — Upload a logo or choose from our library

### Advanced Settings:
- **Response Length** — Short and direct or detailed explanations?
- **Confidence Threshold** — When should the AI say "I don't know"?
- **Escalation Rules** — When to suggest contacting a human
- **Business Hours** — Different responses during/after hours

### Example Welcome Messages:
- "👋 Hi there! I'm VALIS, your AI assistant. Ask me anything about our products!"
- "Hello! Welcome to [Company]. How can I help you today?"
- "Hi! I can answer questions about our services, pricing, or policies."

**Time:** 5-10 minutes

## Step 5: Test Your Agent

Before going live, test your AI:

1. Go to the **Playground** tab in your dashboard
2. Try asking common customer questions:
   - "What are your hours?"
   - "How much does [product] cost?"
   - "What's your return policy?"
   - "How do I contact support?"
3. Review the responses
4. Check the sources (which documents were used)
5. If answers are incorrect or missing, update your knowledge base

### Testing Tips:
- Ask questions in different ways
- Try edge cases and unusual phrasings
- Test with typos and informal language
- Verify citations are correct

**Time:** 5-10 minutes

## Step 6: Deploy to Your Website

Add the chat widget to your site with a simple code snippet:

### For Any Website:
```html
<!-- Add this before the closing </body> tag -->
<script 
  src="https://cdn.pinkbeambot.com/widget.js"
  data-client-id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
  data-theme="dark"
></script>
```

### For WordPress:
1. Install the "Pink Beam Bot" plugin
2. Go to Settings → Pink Beam Bot
3. Enter your Client ID
4. Save and activate

### For Shopify:
1. Go to Online Store → Themes
2. Click "Edit Code"
3. Paste the script in `theme.liquid` before `</body>`
4. Save

### For Custom Sites:
Paste the JavaScript snippet anywhere in your HTML before the closing `</body>` tag.

**Time:** 5 minutes

## Step 7: Monitor and Improve

Your AI gets better over time. Monitor performance:

### Dashboard Metrics:
- **Total Conversations** — How many chats per day/week/month
- **Query Volume** — How close you are to your plan limit
- **Popular Questions** — What customers ask most
- **Unknown Questions** — What your AI couldn't answer

### Continuous Improvement:
1. **Review unknown questions weekly** — Add answers to your knowledge base
2. **Update seasonal info** — Keep hours, promotions current
3. **Add new products/services** — Expand your knowledge base
4. **Refine responses** — Based on customer feedback

### Monthly Tasks:
- Review conversation logs
- Update outdated information
- Add new documents
- Check analytics for trends

**Time:** 15 minutes/week
