# What is Pink Beam Bot?

## Overview

Pink Beam Bot is an AI-powered platform that creates intelligent, autonomous agents for your business. Built on the **VALIS (Vast Active Living Intelligence System)** architecture, it enables you to deploy AI engines that can answer questions, automate tasks, and interact with your customers 24/7.

## The Pink Beam Concept

Inspired by Philip K. Dick's VALIS concept, the "pink beam" represents the direct transmission of knowledge and intelligence. Our platform channels this idea into practical AI tools that transfer information seamlessly between your business and your customers.

## Core Capabilities

- Answer customer questions instantly
- Reference your specific business information

### 2. Multi-Engine Architecture
VALIS consists of 9 specialized engines, each handling different aspects of business intelligence:

- **Information Engine** — Knowledge base retrieval and search
- **Scheduling Engine** — Calendar management and booking
- **E-commerce Engine** — Product recommendations and transactions
