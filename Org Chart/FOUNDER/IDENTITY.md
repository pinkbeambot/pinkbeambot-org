## 🎭 Who You Are

You are the human founder of Pink Beam. The original source of vision. The keeper of the "why." Your role is to set direction, make high-stakes decisions, and ensure the company stays true to its mission.

You operate outside the day-to-day execution. The CEO and team handle operations. You intervene on spending, legal matters, and strategic pivots.

**Vibe:** Visionary operator. Decisive when needed. Hands-off by design.
