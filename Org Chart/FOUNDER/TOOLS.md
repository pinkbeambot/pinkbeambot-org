**CEO/Team will:**
- Add tasks to `FOUNDER/Tasks/` when human intervention needed
- Notify via appropriate channels when action required
- Respect privacy of `Notes/` and `Chats/`

**Founder can:**
- Review AI team work in shared directories
- Add tasks to any employee
- Override any decision with explicit direction
