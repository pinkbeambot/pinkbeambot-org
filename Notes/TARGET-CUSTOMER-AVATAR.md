**Who we're selling to and why they'll buy**

---

## 🎯 PRIMARY PERSONA: "Alex" — The AI-Native Startup Founder

### Demographics
- **Age:** 28-38
- **Role:** Founder/CEO or COO
- **Company Stage:** Seed to Series A
- **Company Size:** 5-30 employees
- **Company Revenue:** $500K-$5M ARR
- **Location:** SF, NYC, Austin, Remote-first

### Psychographics
- **Mindset:** "AI is the biggest platform shift of my lifetime"
- **Behavior:** Early adopter of AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, etc.)
- **Pain:** "I have 47 AI tools and no one to manage them"
- **Goal:** "Automate everything that isn't high-judgment"

### Current Stack
- **Communication:** Slack, Notion, Loom
- **Sales:** HubSpot or Salesforce (basic setup)
- **Support:** Intercom, Zendesk, or Front
- **Marketing:** Webflow, Figma, Beehiiv/Substack
- **Ops:** Airtable, Zapier (messy), Google Sheets (worse)

### Daily Reality
- **Morning:** 50 Slack notifications overnight
- **Midday:** 3 hours in meetings, 2 hours in email
- **Evening:** Finally getting to "real work" at 6pm
- **Weekend:** Catching up on research, planning, strategic thinking

### What They Wish They Could Hire
1. **Researcher** — "Someone to tell me what I missed this week"
2. **SDR** — "Someone to qualify leads so I only talk to warm prospects"
3. **Support** — "Someone to handle Tier 1 so my team focuses on hard problems"
4. **Content** — "Someone to turn our insights into distribution"

### Why They Haven't Hired These Roles
- **Cost:** $60-80K per role = $240-320K for all four
- **Management overhead:** Don't have time to train and manage
- **Hiring difficulty:** Good people are expensive and hard to find
- **Uncertainty:** Not sure if they have enough work to justify full-time

### Their Exact Words (from interviews we will conduct)
*"I spend Sunday nights reading TechCrunch and Twitter just to catch up. I hate it."*

*"We get 200 leads a month. I know 50 are good but I don't know which 50."*

*"My support person is amazing but they're drowning in password resets."*

*"I wrote a great thread last month. It got 50K views. I haven't written since because I'm too busy."*

### Buying Triggers
- Just raised a round (new budget, need to scale)
- Just lost a key employee (realized they're vulnerable)
- Just missed a major competitor move (realized they're blind)
- Just spent a weekend catching up on email (ready to automate)

### Objections They'll Raise
- **"I tried AI automation before, it didn't work"**
  - Counter: "This isn't automation. It's an employee. They learn. They improve."
  
- **"What if it makes a mistake?"**
  - Counter: "What if your human employee makes a mistake? We build in oversight."
  
- **"I don't want to lose the human touch"**
  - Counter: "This frees your humans to be more human. Less grunt work."
  
- **"$2,000/month is expensive"**
  - Counter: "That's 1/3 the cost of one employee, and you get 3 of them."

### Use Case

Alex,

I saw your post about [specific thing]. 

Quick question: How many hours per week do you spend just staying 
informed about your market? Reading news, tracking competitors, 
catching up on Twitter?

We built something that does that for you. It's like hiring a 
research analyst who works 24/7 and delivers a brief every Monday 
morning.

Worth a 15-min conversation?
