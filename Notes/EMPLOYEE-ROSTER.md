# EMPLOYEE ROSTER

**The AI employees we're hiring for our customers**

---

## 🎯 Philosophy

Each employee has:
- **A clear role** — Job title, responsibilities, success metrics
- **A personality** — How they communicate, their "vibe"
- **Tools they use** — Integrations and software
- **A manager** — How humans oversee them
- **Handoff protocols** — When and how they escalate
