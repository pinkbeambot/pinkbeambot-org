# 0-TO-BUSINESS ROADMAP

**From:** Idea (Today)  
**To:** $1M ARR (Target: 18 months)  
**Approach:** Build mature product quickly using OpenClaw advantage

## 🎯 The Goal

**Pink Beam** becomes the default way AI-native companies hire AI employees. Not automation. Not workflows. Employees.

**Success metric:** 100 customers paying $2,000/month average = $2.4M ARR. Conservative target: 50 customers = $1.2M ARR.

## ⚠️ Key Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| OpenClaw becomes unreliable | Medium | High | Build abstraction layer, be ready to swap orchestrators |
| AI quality degrades | Medium | High | Multi-model approach, human-in-the-loop |
| Customers don't want "employees" | Medium | High | Pivot to "automation" positioning |
| Unit economics don't work | Medium | High | Price optimization, efficiency improvements |
| Big tech builds this | High | Medium | Focus on niche, move fast, build brand |
