### Shift @ 01:17 AM — TASK-001 Phase 1 Review

**Active Task:** [[Tasks/TASK-001-pricing-marketing-implementation]]

**Completed:**
- Acquired work lock as CMO
- Reviewed Phase 1 deliverables against strategy document
- Verified all 7 checklist items completed:
  - Hero copy with new headline "Your Website Works While You Sleep"
  - Value-focused subhead with "No coding required"
  - Updated CTAs: "See What It Can Do" + "View Plans"
  - How It Works 4-step process
  - All 5 pricing tier descriptions match strategy
  - 3 trust signal badges in hero
  - Meta description optimized with keywords
- Approved Phase 1 for quality and brand alignment
- Updated phase_reviews status to "approved"
- Set next_worker for Phase 2 (Content Expansion)
- Attempted to trigger ENG-FE (3 retries failed — documented in task)

**Handed off to:** [[Org Chart/ENG-FE/IDENTITY]] (Phase 2: Content Expansion)

**Blockers:**
- Gateway timeout prevented automatic handoff trigger
- Manual trigger needed: `cron run pbb-eng-fe-shift`

**Notes:**
Phase 1 implementation is solid. Code quality is high, copy matches the CMO strategy doc exactly, and the visual execution is consistent with our design system. ENG-FE is clear to proceed with Phase 2 (FAQ expansion, testimonials section, meta description updates across pages).
