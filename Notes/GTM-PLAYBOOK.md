## 🎯 Outbound Playbooks

### Cold Email Sequence (SDR Employee)

**Email 1: Pattern Interrupt**
```
Subject: Your Sunday night TechCrunch habit

Alex,

I saw your post about [specific thing from their Twitter]. 

Quick question: How many hours per week do you spend just staying 
informed about your market?

We built something that does that for you. It's like hiring a 
research analyst who works 24/7.

Worth a 15-min conversation?

[Name]
Pink Beam
```

**Email 2: Value Add (Day 3)**
```
Subject: Re: Your Sunday night TechCrunch habit

Alex,

I noticed [Competitor X] just [did something]. 

Thought you might find this relevant given your work on [their product].

This is exactly the kind of intel our Researcher surfaces automatically.

Still interested in a quick demo?

[Name]
```

**Email 3: Breakup (Day 7)**
```
Subject: Closing the loop

Alex,

I reached out about helping you stay on top of market intel without 
the Sunday night reading sessions.

I didn't hear back, so I'll assume timing isn't right.

If things change, you know where to find us.

Good luck with [Company]!

[Name]
```

### LinkedIn Outreach

**Connection Request:**
"Hey Alex — love your insights on [topic]. I'm building something for founders like you. Worth connecting?"

**First Message (after connect):**
"Thanks for connecting! Quick question — how do you currently stay on top of competitor moves and industry trends?"

**Follow-up (if they engage):**
"We've been hearing that from a lot of founders. We built an AI Researcher that monitors everything and delivers a Monday morning brief. Worth a 15-min chat?"

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Building before launching** — Launch at 70% ready, iterate publicly
2. **Ignoring existing network** — Your first 10 customers are people you know
3. **Trying to be everywhere** — Pick 2-3 channels, master them
4. **No follow-up** — 80% of sales happen after 5+ touches
5. **Feature-focused messaging** — Lead with outcomes, not capabilities
6. **Neglecting retention** — It's 5x cheaper to keep customers than acquire
